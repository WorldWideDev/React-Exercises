            Assignment mentions a previous "Bubble" component, which doesn't seem to 
                exist in the current state of curriculum
            Update that reference to something else, this aspect of the assignment isn't hugely
                important w/r/t the particular component used

            Wireframe references "Service", assuming this an Angular reference?
            Rename this to something like "state", although which component's state holds this value
            is up to interpretation.

            After some trial/error/research, this assignment seems only reasonable when used with 
            Redux/some other state management.

            Aside from a good amount of "callback hell" required to pass a mine/sell/buy transaction up to app state, this
            also would require passing props to a Route component, with the requisite callback.  Something that seems outside
            the scope of what we want to teach with react-router after having just seen it.

            Assignment asks you to "route" to /profile, when this module is placed before Client-Side Routing (ReactJSdec2017)
            Either Redux needs to go back to being listed AFTER Client-Side routing, or these assignments need to be modified slightly, the issue with
            swapping back, is that a few assignments in Client-Side Routing seem to rely on a redux-style architecture.
